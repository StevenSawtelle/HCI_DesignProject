                  <span class="commtext c00">WARNING: PERSONAL OPINION AHEAD<p>To understand why this keeps happening, you need to understand the product and engineering culture at Google. As a group, Google engineers and PMs are <i>obsessed</i> with promotion. At the heart of every conversation about system design or product proposal lies an unspoken (and sometimes spoken) question: will working on this get me promoted?<p>The criteria for promotion at Google, especially at the higher levels like SWE III -&gt; Senior and especially at Senior -&gt; Staff and above, explicitly talk about impact on the organization and the business. This has consequences for the kind of teams people try to join and kind of work they choose to do. Maintenance engineering is so not-rewarded that it&#x27;s become an inside joke. Any team that isn&#x27;t launching products starts bleeding staff, any project that isn&#x27;t going to make a big splash is going to be neglected, and any design that doesn&#x27;t &quot;demonstrate technical complexity&quot; will be either rejected or trumped up.<p>This is as important in the product management, people management, and general leadership roles as in engineering. The incentive throughout is to create a product, launch it, apply for promotion, and move on to bigger and better things as soon as possible. In my time at Google I saw organization after organization pay lip service to rewarding maintenance and &quot;preferring landings over launches&quot; and “improving product excellence” but (at least in my experience) nothing stuck.<p>Usually an organization starts with a top-down direction and the rest of the company is compensated for executing it. Not at Google. The &quot;let a thousand flowers bloom&quot; approach that developed from the early days of twenty percent time and total engineering independence has created a disorganized mess of a company. Multiply the individual incentives fifty thousand times and you get a company that throws stuff at the wall to see if it sticks, and if it doesn&#x27;t kills it immediately.<p>Edit&#x2F;Addendum:<p>This is also why GMail, YouTube, Search, GCP, Android, and others aren’t going anywhere. They’re making money, they’re core to the business, and there’s plenty of opportunity to work on them and get promoted. They all also share one thing in common: deep down they’re frontends for search or advertising (GCP and Apps are an exception because they make money on their own). Measuring and proving impact on search numbers is a well-known promo narrative at Google, so those products are a safe bet for employees and users. Streaming game services, not so much.</span>

                  <span class="commtext c00">Previously I worked at Waymo for a year on the perception module of the self driving car. Based on what I know about the state of the art of computer vision, I can pretty much guarantee that current Tesla cars will never be autonomous. This is probably a huge risk for the investors of Tesla, because currently Tesla is selling a fully-autonomous option on its car which will never happen with current hardware. We need several breakthroughs in computer vision for no-fail image based object detection, and you will need higher resolution cameras, and much much more compute power to be able to process all the images. It&#x27;s hard to estimate when we will reach that level of advancement in computer vision, my most optimistic wild guess is 10-20 years. And then Tesla will need to upgrade all those cameras and install a dedicated TPU which should be at least 10x or probably more faster than the nVidia chip they have installed on their cars, and they should do it for zero dollars because they have already sold the option. It is kinda amazing that Elon Musk is selling cars based on speculative future breakthroughs in technology. That must be a first.</span>

I know that will disappoint some people, but I do this for fun in my own spare time.  If it stops being fun, I will stop working on it, which will pretty much kill the project.  There are millions of projects in the world and the only reason they continue (if they actually do) is because the maintainers stubbornly stick at it.<p>With that in mind, here is the code of conduct: If it is fun for me then it is good.  If it is not fun for me, then it is not good.<p>Things I find fun include: Bug reports that explain what you saw and what you expected to see. Suggestions for features that would make your life better.  Stories of how the software so far has already made your life better.  Entertaining stories of how you used the software (bonus points if it includes pictures of cats).  Offers to volunteer to improve something (super bonus points if you <i>actually</i> improve it).  Questions about how the software works.  Offers to write documentation (super, executive class bonus points if you actually write some).  Answering questions that other people ask (bonus points if you get the answers right).<p>Things I don&#x27;t find fun:  Drama.  That is all.<p>To some extent, I will accept drama in exchange for money.  But it has to be a <i>lot</i> of money.  Think FANG level money.  If you don&#x27;t have FANG level money that you are willing to give me in exchange for drama, just don&#x27;t do it -- even if you think it is the most important thing in the world.<p>There is no other code of conduct.  I may arbitrarily declare some things fun for me and some things not fun.  Please pay attention when I declare one way or the other and act accordingly.<p>Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="commtext c00">The Impossible Burger is the best veggie burger I&#x27;ve ever had.<p>I was a vegetarian for 10 years, and have now been a pescatarian for 8 years. It has been 18 years since I have had a proper cheeseburger, and since then I have had <i>many thousands</i> of veggie burgers. Cheeseburgers are probably my favorite food, and I haven&#x27;t had one in 18 years. If someone told me that the world would end tomorrow, I would go out and eat a proper cheeseburger.<p>I have some experience in this area, is what I&#x27;m trying to say. The flavor and texture is the closest to actual meat I&#x27;ve ever had. And that, then, is the key for a lot of people: they don&#x27;t <i>want</i> a veggie burger that simulates meat. Which is fine! I do, and I imagine the market for close-to-meat veggie burgers is bigger than obviously-not-meat veggie burgers.<p>Others in the thread have mentioned the Beyond Burger, which is also good.  But the Impossible Burger, for me, is way better. I have had my Impossible Burgers at Bareburger. At home, I went with Morningstar Farm&#x27;s Grillers Prime for a long time, but about a year ago they changed the recipe, and I did their black bean for a while. I have since discovered if I season the Griller&#x27;s Prime while I&#x27;m frying it, it comes out much better.</span>

                  <span class="commtext c00">There&#x27;s a general misconception between being productive and being effective.<p>One can fill their days by completing many mindless tasks and consider themselves as productive, but in the end hardly any of those tasks really matters.<p>On the other hand, another person may only complete one or two tasks in a very short time during their day but these were critical tasks that could generate much higher values. This subsequently makes the person more effective than their peers.<p>The output values must be weight in determining if one is really productive. Effectiveness triumphs mindless productivity.<p>This is quite similar to the cognitive and decision fatigue principle which indicates that each of us only has a limited pool of cognitive resources and so we must be very selective in choosing what activities we engage in.<p>To remain highly effective, not just being productive, particularly for a project manager, it&#x27;s imperative to spend time only on tasks that require critical decisions to be made, and to delegate the rest. When you take on more tasks than you can handle, like some are misunderstanding this may help them appear as productive, it will undoubtedly affect the quality of each of your decisions and the project will suffer.</span>

You can no longer give your girlfriend, boyfriend, dog sitter, relatives, or whoever you wish a key or access card to your home. You have to enroll that person in the facial database. And whoever is doing the enrolling can ask for lots of further information about your visitor, or take that opportunity of enrolling to impose restrictions on your visitor, or just say no -- you&#x27;re not allowed that visitor.

                  <span class="commtext c00">Closing inbox has really made me re-evaluate if I want to continue using Google for email, as the clusterf--- of garbage that Gmail has turned into for people with long-standing accounts is untenable. The kitchen-sink approach of gmail has created a website&#x2F;app that wants to meet every need and honestly meets none.<p>In the next 24 hours or so I&#x27;ll be forced from a clean and clear perfectly rolled up and ideal notifying Inbox back to the utterly uncontrollable insanity of Gmail. The &quot;rollups&quot; in Gmail don&#x27;t work, the filtering is arcane and unchanged from the 2001-era, the &quot;labels&quot; are useless at intelligently combating spam&#x2F;marketing, and my gmail inbox receives hundreds of emails a day, 0 of which I care about, and hundreds of which google desperately wants to mark important, put in my inbox, notify me about, and provide precisely 0 tools to intelligently control it.<p>My gmail is a nightmare of anxiety that no man could ever wrestle control over (while my Inbox is a delightful walk through an orderly park) and I am honestly just considering abandoning this gmail account.<p>Of course, this gmail account IS my google account, it IS my google existence.<p>If Google has broken email, their core app, my core account --- maybe it&#x27;s time to leave.<p>I can&#x27;t be the only one approaching Google this way. Sooner or later, they&#x27;ll kill what you love about them, too.</span>

                  <span class="commtext c00">In my experience, by far the best way to get a raise is to find a new job that you think you will like as much or more than your current job and take it.  In addition to the monetary benefits, this will open the door to meeting new people and take on new responsibilities.  I&#x27;ve never regretted doing this, and more than once that action gave my overall career trajectory a huge boost, even when I already thought I was happy (which was the case most of the time).</span>

                  <span class="commtext c00">There goes me and my co-founder&#x27;s plan of disrupting the Mobile VPN market. Or may be, we still have a chance?<p>Anywho, congratulations Cloudflare! I long held an opinion that the VPN market was ripe for disruption when I looked at privacy policy of some of the top players. Having analysed the market, I find that its defragmented  with no clear run-away winner. I hope you&#x27;re able to make a headway with all the interesting innovations that you plan to offer on top of it.<p>Here are some ideas that I had in mind for a Mobile VPN:<p>1. Ability to run a dns-blacklist, tag-based blacklist, and a ip-firewall at cloudflare&#x27;s end (not on the end devices). May be you could add that as an option to your wrap+ product?<p>2. Auto change exit IPs underneath the covers.<p>3. Take over the dialer and route calls over IP whenever possible.<p>4. Provide ability to analyze traffic on a PC.<p>5. Track and warn mode per app, where the traffic is analysed for a particular app to generate a report on what its doing and how much.<p>Basically, bring enterprise-grade security to the end consumer.</span>

That&#x27;s the point of copyright and has been the case for a long time. It&#x27;s also illegal to watch&#x2F;consume content yourself in any way that the copyright-holder didn&#x27;t explicitly enable, even if you have a general right to watch&#x2F;consume that content. You&#x27;re not allowed to create a browser that can watch DRM-protected Netflix content. And if someone does create such a browser, it&#x27;s illegal for you to use it, even if you pay for a Netflix subscription.<p>That&#x27;s pretty new (circa 1996 or so).<p>In 2002 I went to see Lawrence Lessig argue the Supreme Court challenge of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which introduced these anti-circumvention concepts.
